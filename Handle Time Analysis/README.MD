## Overview

Welcome to the Handle Time Analysis project! This repository features a Jupyter Notebook file named Handle Time Analysis.ipynb. The notebook delves into an analysis of a call center scenario, where the hypothesis under consideration is that phone representatives experience fatigue as the number of calls they handle in a single day increases.

### Files:
 1. Handle Time Analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that explores the relationship between the number of calls handled by phone representatives in a call center and the potential impact of fatigue on handling times.

## Why it's Useful

Understanding the dynamics of call center operations and the potential effects of workload on phone representatives is crucial for optimizing efficiency and employee well-being. The Handle Time Analysis project provides insights into the correlation between the number of calls handled and potential fatigue, shedding light on areas for improvement.

### Key Benefits

 - Fatigue Impact: Explore the hypothesis that increased call volume may lead to longer handle times, indicating potential fatigue among phone representatives.
 - Operational Optimization: Gain insights into how the call center's operations might be optimized to maintain efficiency while addressing the well-being of phone representatives.
 - Data-Driven Decision Making: Use data analysis techniques to make informed decisions regarding staffing, breaks, or other interventions that can positively impact both productivity and employee satisfaction

By delving into the Handle Time Analysis, you contribute to a data-driven approach for managing call center operations, promoting a balanced and efficient work environment. Feel free to explore the notebook, analyze the findings, and adapt the analysis for specific call center scenarios or contribute to the ongoing conversation around call center optimization.

## Overview

Welcome to the Pet Adoption Statistics Project! This repository houses three Python files – Pet Adoption from API, Pet Adoption from CSV, and Pet Adoption from HTML. Each of these files serves the purpose of retrieving pet adoption statistics from the Austin Animal Center using distinct methods.

## Why it's Useful

Understanding pet adoption statistics is crucial for animal welfare organizations, researchers, and enthusiasts alike. This project provides three different methods to access and analyze such data, catering to diverse preferences and requirements.

### Key Benefits

 - Versatility: Choose the method that best suits your needs – whether it's real-time data retrieval from the API, working with pre-existing CSV files, or scraping information from HTML pages.
 - Data Analysis: Use the extracted statistics to gain insights into pet adoption trends, demographics, and other valuable information.
 - Educational: Explore and learn about various data retrieval techniques in Python while contributing to a meaningful cause – promoting awareness about pet adoption.

By leveraging these files, you contribute to the accessibility and usability of pet adoption data, fostering a collaborative and informed community dedicated to the well-being of animals. Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this project!

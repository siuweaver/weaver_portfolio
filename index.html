    <!-- Data Science Journey Section -->
    <section id="journey">
        <h2>Data Science Journey</h2>
        <p>The spark for my journey into this field ignited during my collaboration with data scientists at Mutual of Omaha. Witnessing their transformative capabilities left me inspired, prompting me to explore how data science could enhance my effectiveness in my role.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Education Section -->
    <section id="education">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I hold a master's degree in data science from Bellevue University, where I delved into the realms of Python, R, and various machine learning models. This academic journey equipped me with the tools to bridge the gap between data analysis and predictive analytics.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Career Goals Section -->
    <section id="career">
        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>Currently, I lead a dynamic team, and my career goal is to elevate our analytics maturity from Diagnostic (Why did it happen) to Predictive (What will happen) on the analytics maturity model. I thrive on the challenge of pushing the boundaries of what data can reveal and contributing to strategic decision-making.</p>

			<p>This repository features a Jupyter Notebook file named Handle Time Analysis.ipynb. The notebook delves into an analysis of a call center scenario, where the hypothesis under consideration is that phone representatives experience fatigue as the number of calls they handle in a single day increases.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/siuweaver/weaver_portfolio/tree/main/Pet%20Adoption%20Import" target="_blank">Pet Adoption Import</a>
            <p>This repository houses three Python files; Pet Adoption from API, Pet Adoption from CSV, and Pet Adoption from HTML. Each of these files serves the purpose of retrieving pet adoption statistics from the Austin Animal Center using distinct methods.</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/siuweaver/weaver_portfolio/tree/main/Predicting%20Length%20of%20Stay%20for%20Dogs%20in%20Austin%20Animal%20Center" target="_blank">Predicting Length of Stay for Dogs in Austin Animal Center</a>
            <p>This repository features a Jupyter Notebook file named Predicting Length of Stay for Dogs in Austin Animal Center.ipynb. The notebook is dedicated to predicting the length of stay for dogs in the Austin Animal Center, employing linear regression models for accurate estimations.</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/siuweaver/weaver_portfolio/tree/main/Weather%20Application" target="_blank">Weather Application</a>
			<p>This repository contains a Python script named Weather Application.py. The purpose of this script is to provide users with real-time weather information based on user input, such as a zip code or city. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, the script retrieves and displays the current temperature for the specified location.</p>

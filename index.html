	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		Greetings! I'm [Your Full Name], a seasoned Lead Business Intelligence Analyst with a keen focus on call center analytics. My expertise lies in leveraging SQL, data analysis, business intelligence, forecasting, scheduling, and reporting solutions to drive actionable insights.

		The spark for my journey into data science ignited during my collaboration with data scientists at Mutual of Omaha. Witnessing their transformative capabilities left me inspired, prompting me to explore how data science could enhance my role.

		I hold a master's degree in data science from Bellevue University, where I delved into the realms of Python, R, and various machine learning models. This academic journey equipped me with the tools to bridge the gap between data analysis and predictive analytics.

		Currently, I lead a dynamic team, and my career goal is to elevate our analytics maturity from Diagnostic (Why did it happen) to Predictive (What will happen) on the analytics maturity model. I thrive on the challenge of pushing the boundaries of what data can reveal and contributing to strategic decision-making.

		Beyond the world of data, you'll find me immersed in diverse interests. Cycling, board games, pickleball, kayaking, and disc golf are my go-to activities outside of the analytics realm. These hobbies not only recharge me but also contribute to my well-rounded perspective.

		Join me on this exciting journey as we navigate the data-driven landscape and explore the endless possibilities that data science brings.

		Let's turn data into insights and insights into impact!
